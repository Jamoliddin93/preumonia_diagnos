**Pneumonia Detection using Fastai**
This repository contains a Python script for pneumonia detection using the Fastai library. The code leverages a pre-trained ResNet34 model for image classification on a pneumonia dataset. The dataset is organized using the Fastai DataBlock API, and the model is fine-tuned on the training set. The performance of the model is evaluated on a validation set, and key metrics such as accuracy and loss are recorded during the training process.

Requirements:
Python 3.x
Fastai
Pandas
